description: The Ship boded no good to Silver Gap as any one could tell. It had brought
  the plague and the flood; it brought bad crops and raids on hidden stills; it waited
  until its evil cargo had done its worst and then it sailed away in the night, bearing
  its pitiful load of dead, or its burden of fear and hate. Surely there was good
  and sufficient reason for dreading the appearance of The Ship, and on a certain
  autumn morning it appeared and soon after the two women, unknown to each other,
  came to Ridge House and this story began.
